# AI-ML-Prompt_engineering-Lab

## Lab Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to develop practical skills in prompt engineering by generating a SWOT analysis for a selected company within a chosen field. Through iterative experimentation with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs), I will refine prompts to produce high-quality outputs, compare results, and create a polished final PDF document that connects my field of study to potential interview contexts.

###Selected Company
For the purpose of this assignment I have selected Winston & Strawn LLP which is a lawfirm that has a security and complainace analyst position available that is inline with my career goals.
